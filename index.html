<br><strong>Key Features of Pikamoon:
<br></strong>
<br><strong>P2E Ecosystem:</strong> Pikamoon operates within a special P2E ecosystem characterized by a rich history and lore. The Pikaverse is a realm inhabited by immortal creatures with great power over the elements. Players can explore this fantastical world, complete missions, and earn Pikamoon tokens ($PIKA) to level up their avatars.
<br>
<br><strong>Gameplay Inspired by Pokémon: </strong>Pikamoon draws inspiration from popular games like Pokémon and Fortnite. It features vibrant visuals, 3D animations, and a distinct artistic style that creates an engaging and immersive gaming experience. The gameplay focuses on combat, strategy, and exploration.

Thirty percent of the total token supply has been allocated for the presale, with the remaining distribution divided among liquidity pool, team and advisors, staking rewards, ecosystem development, and marketing.
